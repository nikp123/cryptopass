If you want a feature/suggestion, just make an issue on this repo.
I'm also free for pull requests, just don't make this small program too bloaty ;)

Possible features:

 *) Add the ability to pass "argv" parameters.
 *) Add the ability to change the pbkdf iteration count (in case CPUs get faster)
 *) Add the ability to copy to clipboard
 *) Possibility to support multiple OS-es, if demanded enough.
 *) Add the ability for it to be headless (aka. API and/or library)

Maintenance:
 *) Look for potential security holes (these happen, even for small programs like this)
 *) Split the code into multiple files so it isn't all crammed in just like this
 *) Possible refactoring/rewrite because this is a "just got it working version"
